# College Map 

This project uses the [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/) library to create an interactive map of a college campus. The map includes markers for various departments, roads, lawns, gates, and a visual boundary for the campus.

## üó∫Ô∏è Features

- **Interactive Map** centered at the college location.
- **Department Markers**: Each major department/building is marked with a popup showing its name and an image.
- **Roads and Paths**: Main roads and walkways are illustrated using white polylines.
- **Lawns**: Green lawn areas between buildings are drawn using polygons.
- **Campus Boundary**: The overall college campus is enclosed with a transparent boundary polygon.

- Admin Block  
- Botany, Physics, Chemistry, Zoology, HPE, Islamiyat  
- BS Block, Computer Science, Library, FSC Classes, Economy  
- Masjid, Secrecy, Hostel  
- Girls Gate & Boys Gate  

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
